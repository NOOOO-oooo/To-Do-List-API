A simple Todo list API where users can sign up/in and create multiple lists.
it's a mix between a todo list and a task manager.
The user can change his profile picture and add one picture related to the task's content.

Dependecies used:
-Express
-nodemon
-Prisma
-Bcrypt
-JWT
-JOI
-fs
-Multer

I did this project just because I wanted to use multer and to implement refresh tokens, it can be scaled way more.
